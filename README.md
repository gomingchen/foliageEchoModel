# foliageEchoModel
A simulation model that can calculate the echoes of multiple scatters (leaves/insect wings). A leaf is simplified as a round disc. A vegetation is approximated as scatters in a space. Thus, a tree can be described in three parameters, leaf density (number/m^3), mean leaf size (mean radius of discs), and mean orientation of the leaf (disc). The pulse is the second harmonic of CF-FM calls of greater horseshoe bats (*Rhinolophus ferrumequinum*), which is important in navigation.

# Applications
It can be used to calculate the echoes of simplified vegetations. Different pulse can be used to calculate echoes from other scatters with different sound source. For example, insect wings can be simplified to discs and the echoes from a group of insects can be modeled to study how bats detect insect swarms.
